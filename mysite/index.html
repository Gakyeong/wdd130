                    <p>I love every story. The real story broadens my views to change myself. Dealing with data is like a treasure hunter of stories. I think it is a fascinating job to find hidden stories and their effect on peopleâ€™s minds. 

                        Now, I am a data visualization specialist in SRR(Student & Record Registration). I do consult with curriculum units on how it can be more effective based on meaningful data. Most of my time is about cleaning data, but I know accuracy is very important because not only suggests correct analysis but also connects to individual life in the past, present, and even future. 
                        
                        In particular, I pursue work in education and the kid/family industry. One time, when I worked as a curriculum processor, different sources had lots of discrepancies that would affect university finances. I captured the moment because my proactive action gave insight to the leader and influenced over 300 students and the university. I enjoyed finding the issues, coming up with effective ways to solve problems, and considering how they will affect the future. From that moment, I see Education and the Kid/Family industry as one field where I will belong.</p>
